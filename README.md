Hi there, this is a short introduction to my web application. 

My application is a social travel app where people can simply add markers to their current location or somewhere that they have 
visted before that they think is unique or cool such as any tourist spot. The users can easily sign up using the sign up page and then log in which then takes
them to the main interactive screen. 

Users can see a total of how many place they have been to on the percentage count at the top left. This will be registered by a total o tourist spots
all over the world and then also niche spots that have been listed across social medias. There is also the capability where the user
can then share their locations to their favourite social medias by just using the socal medias share button in the 'RANKscreen'.

Thankyou for reaching out to my application and hope you have a freidnly experience.
